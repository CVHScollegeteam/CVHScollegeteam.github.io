<li><p> MCA Denver’s Failure Awards Scholarship: 
 The Museum of Contemporary Art Denver is awarding over $20,000 in college scholarships to the next generation of creative, innovative, and fearless graduating high school seniors who demonstrate a willingness to risk failure in the pursuit of something new. The Failure Awards scholarships reward Colorado students who embrace the spirit of creative risk-taking with scholarship monies that can be used at any accredited four-year institution towards educational expenses. While so much of student life is focused on achievement, MCA Denver believes that in order to create something original and authentic, it is necessary to risk failure. The Failure Awards are given not on the basis of academic merit or athletic prowess, but rather on a student’s demonstration of a willingness to take these risks. <a class="brand" href= "https://mcadenver.org/teens/scholarships">Apply Here!</a>.</p></li>

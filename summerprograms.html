<p> Journey to JD: CU Boulder is providing a great opportunity for rising juniors interested in law. The university is hosting a week long summer program, from June 23-29, 2019, for up to up to twenty diverse rising high school juniors. This program will support, mentor, and encourage these students to attend college, and, ultimately, law school, to pursue legal opportunities in the region. While residing on-campus at the University of Colorado Boulder over this one-week period, students will be given a first look at the scope and reach of the legal profession through a multi-faceted program that will include a classroom component led by law school faculty, attorneys and students, a field-trip component to highlight the different careers and opportunities in the legal profession, and a final report-out by the students on their experience in the program. After the formal program ends, we will look to connect these students with legal mentors in their area as well as additional resources to assist with college preparation.‚Äù  <a class="brand" href= https://centerforlegalinclusiveness.org/journey-to-jd/">Apply Here!</a>.</p>
